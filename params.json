{"name":"ConnectionSpotter","tagline":"","body":"### What Is ConnectionSpotter?\r\nConnectionSpotter is a Firefox add-on that enhances the news reading experience by revealing hidden connections between politicians, business people, corporations, and organizations. ConnectionSpotter builds on [Poligraft](http://poligraft.com/), [OpenSecrets](http://www.opensecrets.org/), and [LittleSis](http://www.littlesis.org/).\r\n\r\nTry ConnectionSpotter out on these articles:\r\n* [F.C.C. Seeks a New Path on 'Net Neutrality' Rules](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/business/fcc-to-propose-new-rules-on-open-internet.html)\r\n* [Report Opens Way to Approval for Keystone Pipeline](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/us/politics/report-may-ease-way-to-approval-of-keystone-pipeline.html?_r=1)\r\n* [Profit Increases, but Revenue Falls at Northrop](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/business/profit-rises-but-sales-fall-at-northrop-grumman.html?_r=0)\r\n\r\n### Installation Instructions\r\n1. Download the add-on by clicking on the .zip link above.\r\n2. Uncompress/unzip the zip file. It contains a single `.xpi` file.\r\n3. Download Firefox [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/) if you don't already have it.\r\n4. Open Firefox and press `Cmd-o` (or `Ctrl-o` if on windows). Navigate to the `.xpi` file you just downloaded and click Open. Click \"Install Now\" when prompted.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT**: ConnectionSpotter may not work if you are not using the latest version of Firefox. ConnectionSpotter requires version 26 or later. At time of publishing, if you are using the latest ESR release, then your browser does not support ConnectionSpotter. Download a standard distribution before continuing. You can do so with the link in step 3.\r\n\r\n**CARLETON**: Lab machines at Carleton do not have the latest version of Firefox, so download a newer version from the link provided above. There is also a conflict between ConnectionSpotter and one of the add-ons that is installed on the lab machines. You must reset the Firefox profile before performing step 4. This [link](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems#w_reset-firefox-to-its-default-state) explains how to do that (it's easy!).\r\n\r\nIf you ever want to uninstall ConnectionSpotter, follow the instructions [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-or-remove-add-ons).\r\n\r\n### How To Use\r\nAfter installing, a small eye icon will appear in the add-on bar. This icon will usually be located in the lower right corner of the browser window. If you don't see the icon, your add-on bar may be hidden. Unhide the add-on bar by following [these instructions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-bar-quick-access-to-add-ons#w_how-do-i-show-or-hide-the-add-on-bar).\r\n\r\n![button location](https://raw.github.com/NoahCarnahan/connection-spotter/gh-pages/images/button.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you are reading an article, click the eye to find connections!\r\n\r\n![connections](https://raw.github.com/NoahCarnahan/connection-spotter/gh-pages/images/bar.png)\r\n\r\nThe ConnectionSpotter sidebar can be scrolled up and down.
